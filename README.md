# Machine-Learning-with-Titanic-dataset

# Introduction
This project applies the concept of Machine Learning Algorithm (SVC) to predict the survival statues of the passengers in the Titanic ship. The model was evaluated by cross_val with result of 83.04% accuracy

# Requirement 

1. Python
2. Jupyter Note Book
3. Numpy Library
4. Pandas Library
5. Seaborn Library
6. Matplot Library
7. sklearn Library


  # Infomation about the dataset
the Titanic dataset has informations ( such as Name, Gender, Title, ect) about the Passengers who boarded the Titanic ship. RMS Titanic was a Britist Passenger Linear, Opereted by the White Star Line. which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15th April 1912 after after striking an iceberg during her Maiden Voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 Passengeers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sincking possibly one of the  deadliest for a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew much public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic work

# This Project address the following data analysis

1. Data Exploration and Preparation: The goal of data exploration is to learn about characteristics and potential problems of a data set without the need to formulate assumptions about the data beforehand. In statistics, data exploration is often referred to as “exploratory data analysis” and contrasts traditional hypothesis testing

2. Data  transformation: Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format to another, typically from the format of a source system into the required format of a destination system. Data transformation is a component of most data integration and data management tasks, such as data wrangling and data warehousing.
 
4. Data Visualiazation and presentation :  Data visualization is the process of translating large data sets and metrics into charts, graphs and other visuals. The resulting visual representation of data makes it easier to identify and share real-time trends, outliers, and new insights about the information represented in the data.

6. Data/Variable Selection: Data selection is defined as the process of determining the appropriate data type and source,
7.  Modeling : Here we build the model with various machine learning algorithm and choice the best them
